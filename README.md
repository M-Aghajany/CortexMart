- **Profile Management Service**: Handles user details, addresses, and preferences.
- **Email and Number Verification Service**: Ensures identity verification through email/SMS authentication.
- **Audit and Logging Service**: Logs events and transactions for security and compliance.
- **Central Event Bus**: Uses **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for event-driven microservice communication.
