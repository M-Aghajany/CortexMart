# User Management Domain - Technology Stack & Design Patterns

## Finalized Technology Stack

- **Programming Language & Framework:**  
  - **Java 17+** and **Spring Boot** for modern features, robustness, and rapid development.
  - **Spring Cloud Gateway** for handling API Gateway functionality.

- **Messaging & Event Handling:**  
  - **Apache Kafka** as the central event bus for event-driven communication.

- **Containerization & Orchestration:**  
  - **Docker** for containerizing applications.  
  - **Kubernetes** for orchestration, scalability, and resource management.

- **Security & Authentication:**  
  - **Spring Authorization Server** for authentication, token issuance, and role management.

## Design Patterns Mapped to Each Microservice

### 1. API Gateway  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **API Gateway Pattern:** Centralized request routing, authentication, and security.  
  - **Aggregator Pattern (as needed):** Merges responses from multiple services.  
- **Rationale:** Simplifies client interactions by offloading cross-cutting concerns.

### 2. Authorization Provider Service  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **Strategy Pattern:** Supports multiple authentication mechanisms.  
  - **Adapter Pattern:** Integrates with external authentication providers.  
- **Rationale:** Enhances flexibility in authentication strategies.

### 3. Resource Service  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separates read/write operations.  
  - **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts data access logic.  
- **Rationale:** Optimizes performance and maintains separation of concerns.

### 4. Profile Management Service  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **CQRS:** Improves scalability of user profile operations.  
  - **Domain-Driven Design Patterns (Aggregate, Repository):** Maintains data consistency.  
- **Rationale:** Ensures clean separation of concerns in managing user data.

### 5. Email and Number Verification Service  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **Event-Driven Architecture & Observer Pattern:** Supports asynchronous processing.  
  - **Circuit Breaker & Retry Patterns:** Enhances resilience against failures.  
  - **Saga Pattern (if part of multi-step workflows):** Manages distributed transactions.  
- **Rationale:** Provides reliable and scalable verification services.

### 6. Audit and Logging Service  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **Event Sourcing:** Captures and logs all system state changes.  
  - **Interceptor/Sidecar Pattern:** Collects logs centrally without affecting core logic.  
- **Rationale:** Maintains compliance and ensures secure transaction auditing.

### 7. Central Event Bus  
- **Patterns:**  
  - **Publish-Subscribe Pattern:** Decouples services for asynchronous communication.  
  - **Event Bus Pattern:** Manages event distribution across microservices.  
- **Rationale:** Enables loose coupling and enhances system scalability.

## Summary

This architecture, leveraging **Java 17+, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka/RabbitMQ**, ensures high performance, scalability, and maintainability.  
The use of design patterns like **API Gateway, CQRS, Saga, and Event Sourcing** further enhances system resilience and modularity.
